# PowerShell Script: Auto-Update 7-Zip to the Latest Version

### Overview:

This PowerShell script automatically downloads and installs the latest version of 7-Zip without requiring manual updates to the download link. It fetches the latest available version from the official 7-Zip download page, installs it in silent mode, and verifies the installation.

â¸»

How the Script Works:

	1.	Fetch the latest version URL
	â€¢	The script accesses the official 7-Zip download page and extracts the latest .exe installer link.
	â€¢	It eliminates the need for manual URL updates when a new version is released.
	2.	Check the currently installed version
	â€¢	If 7-Zip is installed, the script retrieves its version by running 7z.exe and extracting the version number.
	3.	Download the latest installer
	â€¢	Using Invoke-WebRequest, the script downloads the latest available 7-Zip installer to the systemâ€™s temporary folder.
	4.	Install 7-Zip silently
	â€¢	The installer runs with the /S (silent) argument, meaning no user interaction is required.
	5.	Verify the installation
	â€¢	After installation, the script retrieves the installed 7-Zip version again to confirm that the update was successful.
	6.	Cleanup
	â€¢	The installer file is deleted to free up space.
	7.	Final confirmation
	â€¢	If the version has changed, it confirms the update. Otherwise, it notifies that the version remains the same.
